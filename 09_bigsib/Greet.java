/*
DISCOVERIES
-You can reference another classes methods (IN THE SAME DIRECTORY) by using ClassName.MethodName(Args)
-You can reference the current class's methods (although unnecessary) as ClassName.MethodName(Args)
-You cannot reference classes in other directories by providing file paths from the current directory
-Null... Not sure what it is, found on intertrash
-Main method is hard to reference from a different class because you must have String[] input
-If foo is a String[] and System.out.println(foo) yields <hoodyhah>, using <hoodyhah> to reference foo fails
 (Even tried removing [Ljava.lang.String;)
-You can reference classes with just their .class files

UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS
-Null?
-Why is main so hard to reference? I tried inputting {""} and {"foo"} to be a String[] but it didn't work
 My theory about this is that {""} isn't imediately recognized as String[], since arrays are a bit wack in java
-How does java recognize "foo" as a string but not {"foo"} as String[]?
 (Essentially what allows java to recognize the types of undefined literals)
-printing foo (see below) yields: [Ljava.lang.String;@7cef4e59 . Why can't I use this to reference foo?

		The purpose of this comment is to document my attempts at calling class Queso (see below) even though Queso.java isn't in 09_bigsib

		Queso.main(null);
		Calling Queso.main gave me ALOT of trouble, ended up intertrashing to find null.

		String[] foo={"abcd"};
		Queso.main(foo);
		This worked, since foo is a String[]
