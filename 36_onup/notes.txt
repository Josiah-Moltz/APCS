time spent: .5 hr (30 minutes)

Compile time errors - Syntax error (javac)
Run time errors - Error while running (java)
Logic errors - Code doesn't produce expected result

Compile
=======
ONLY LOOKE AT 1 ERROR AT A TIME!!
	error messages tend to have... errors
Error locations aren't always wehre errors are, could be elsewhere
Check syntax
Check the file!! Ensure you are compiling the file you were just editing!!
Debugging by bisection (desperate)
	Manually binary search for the error, by spliting file up into halves and so on

Run
===
Add prints to reveal the flow of the program 
	Ex: entering/exiting loop
Program "hanging": Program stops and does nothing
	Infinite loop/recursion or LOTS of computation
Null Pointer 
	Instance variable was null
Array Index
	Array index out of bounds
Stack Overflow
	Infinite Recursion
File Not Found
	File not found...
Arithmetic Expression
	Division by 0 and the likes
CLEAN YOUR CODE!!!

Logic
=====
Make hypothesis about why error occurs
Make/correct mental model
Breaking expressions up
Use temporary values to display intermediates
println is more reliable than print

General
=======
TAKE A BREAK!!!
Start small
Use duckie
