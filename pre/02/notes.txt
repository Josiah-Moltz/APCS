Notable Things:
-Java seems similar to C++ (I know a tiny bit from using Asymptote)
-There are TWO types of errors, compile and run time errors.
-You MUST specify a data type in a variable definition.
-Variables can be defined all at the beginning of a document, or incrementally as they are used
-The small errors that occur in arithmetic are because terminating decimals are NON-TERMINATING in binary!!
-Program structure: Package -> Class -> Method -> Statement -> Expression -> Token

Things Left Unclear:
-Scanner (a bit confusing, with lots of syntax)
-Double vs Int division (well explained, I am just a bit shaky)

Overall understanding: 7
