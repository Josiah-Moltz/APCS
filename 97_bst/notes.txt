DISCO
0. be at node before to assign null bc nicer stuff with pointers that idk
QCC
0. Wanted to optimize by finding shortest subtree to use as new root
1. What were we missing?? We understood what was going on but our code got overcomplicated and broken fast.
2. I don't understand pointers.
3. This assignment hurt a lot. Very frustrating.
